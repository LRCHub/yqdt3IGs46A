[00:28.18] [00:28.18]Yo, light that cigarette, I'm trippin'
[00:30.71] [00:30.71]Ash it on my bitches
[00:32.06] [00:32.06]Taking my dose, I never skip it
[00:33.75] [00:33.75]Still in my hood up pistol gripping
[00:35.56] [00:35.56]Still got a hundred blunts
[00:37.32] [00:37.32]Got that Bape up in my cup
[00:39.15] [00:39.15]Still with a bitch in the cut
[00:40.64] [00:40.64]Who stay with my dick in her guts, yeah
[00:43.22] [00:43.22]Wetto the king of the Grey
[00:44.54] [00:44.54]Self-park, I don't fuck with valet, sheesh
[00:46.80] [00:46.80]Private jet, fuck a delay
[00:48.10] [00:48.10]Went to Paris and back in a day
[00:49.81] [00:49.81]Okay, no I'm never okay
[00:51.92] [00:51.92]Bitch, stop asking
[00:53.93] [00:53.93]Came up, supported my family
[00:55.39] [00:55.39]Just for that they should give me a Grammy, uh
[00:57.58] [00:57.58]Running and ducking the slammer, uh
[00:59.37] [00:59.37]Thinking 'bout cocking the hammer
[01:01.15] [01:01.15]The lights, the glitter, the glamour, uh
[01:02.90] [01:02.90]None of this shit even matters
[01:04.73] [01:04.73]None of this shit made me happy
[01:06.64] [01:06.64]Wound up in rehab instead of a casket
[01:08.56] [01:08.56]Locking me up and they had the rooms padded
[01:10.69] [01:10.69]Made a straight jacket my fashion
[01:12.18] [01:12.18]Ruby da motherfucker Grim Reapin', I'm undercover
[01:15.21] [01:15.21]Soul seeking, I found another bitch who's thinkin' that I'm her lover, no
[01:19.19] [01:19.19]Reason I keep on shruggin'
[01:20.56] [01:20.56]Blunt is cashed, let's keep 'em comin'
[01:22.14] [01:22.14]Only weed keeps me from buggin' and from seekin' out more destruction
[01:26.09] [01:26.09]I'm a pro at self-doubt, but I doubt I'll ever know
[01:33.19] [01:33.19]That these bitches want me to fly 'em out
[01:35.93] [01:35.93]Just because I upped the glow
[01:40.50] [01:40.50]All these fuckboys wanna be me, but they keep it on the low
[01:44.16] [01:44.16]And talk shit about me and my cousin while we're thumbin' through our dough
[01:47.89] [01:47.89]All this fame is such a curse, sometimes I wish I was a ghost
[01:51.37] [01:51.37]Watch me raise the fucking dead next time I'm on stage at a show
[01:55.49] [01:55.49]Haunted (haunted), haunted (haunted)
[02:02.54] [02:00.28]
[02:09.70] [02:02.54]Haunted (haunted), haunted (haunted)
[02:14.12] [02:09.70]Haunted, haunted, I can't escape my mind
[02:16.69] [02:14.12]It's like I'm doing time, all the time
[02:21.51] [02:16.69]Exhausted, lost it, just one little line
[02:24.32] [02:21.51]Have this talk with God all the time, yeah
[02:28.40] [02:24.32]Haunted, haunted, I can't escape my mind
[02:31.03] [02:28.40]It's like I'm doing time all the time
[02:35.85] [02:31.03]Exhausted, lost it, just one little line
[02:38.41] [02:35.85]Have this talk with God all the time, yeah
[02:45.32] [02:38.41](All the time, yeah- time, yeah- time, yeah- time, yeah- time, yeah)
[03:26.82] [02:45.32](All- All the time, yeah- time, yeah- time, yeah- time, yeah- time, yeah)
