Hold tight,
(You did good, $lick) hold tight
I'm noticing the mine,
I'm noticing the mine
Hold tight, hold tight
I'm noticing the mine,
I'm noticing the mine
Hold tight, hold tight
I'm noticing the mine,
I'm noticing the mine
Hold tight, hold tight
I'm noticing the mine,
I'm noticing the mine
Yo light that cigarette
I'm tripping
Ash it on my bitches
Taking my dose
I never skip it
Still in my hood up
pistol gripping
Still got 100 blunts
Got that bape up in my cup
Stay with a bitch in the cut
who stay with my dick
in her guts
Wetto the king of the GREY
Self park I don't fuck
with valet
Sheesh
Private jet fuck a delay
Went to Paris and back in a day
Okay
No I'm never okay
Bitch stop asking
Came up and supported my family
Just for that
they should give me a Grammy
Running and ducking the slammer
Thinking bot cocking the hammer
The lights the glitter
the glamour
None of this shit even matters
None of this shit made me happy
Wound up in rehab
instead of a casket
Locking me up
and they had the rooms padded
Made a straight jacket
my fashion
Ruby that motherfucker
Grim reaping
I'm undercover
Soul seeking
I found another bitch
who's thinking that
I'm her lover
No
Reason I keep on shrugging
Blunt is cashed
let's keep 'em coming
Only weed keeps me from bugging
and from seeking out
more destruction
I'm a pro at self doubt
but I doubt I'll ever know
That these bitches want me
to fly 'em out just because
I upped the glow
All these fuckbois wanna be me
but they keep it on the low
And talk shit about me
and my cousin while
we're thumbing through our dough
All this fame is such a curse
sometimes I wish I was a ghost
Watch me raise the fucking dead
next time I'm on stage at a show
Haunted, haunted
Haunted, haunted
Haunted, haunted
Haunted, haunted
Haunted, haunted
I can't escape my mind
It's like
I'm doing time all the time
Exhausted, lost it
Just one little line
Have this talk with God
all the time, yeah
Haunted, haunted
I can't escape my mind
It's like I'm doing time
all the time
Exhausted, lost it
Just one little line
Have this talk with God
all the time, yeah
